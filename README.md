# PackedBubbleChart

This **PackedBubbleChart** is inspired by https://github.com/efremidze/Magnetic.<br />
Magnetic rebuilds the Apple Music interests picker but this repo adds a different spin with the following main additions/changes:

- one SKNode is centered and not movable
- drag, tap and double-tap gestures
- embedded in SwiftUI with Delegate to get selected Tag
- gradients textures on SKNodes that reflect e.g. a completion rate of the given Tag
